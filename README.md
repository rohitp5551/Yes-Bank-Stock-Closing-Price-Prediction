**Project Overview**
The project focuses on predicting the closing stock prices of Yes Bank using historical data. It employs machine learning techniques to derive insights and make accurate predictions. 
**Data Preprocessing**
Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline. It involves the following sub-steps:

 1 Handling Missing Values:

 Identified missing values within the dataset.
Used appropriate methods to fill or remove these values, depending on their impact on the dataset. For instance, rows with excessive missing data might be dropped, while smaller gaps can be filled using techniques such as forward fill or interpolation.

 2 Correcting Data Types:

 Ensured that each column in the dataset had the correct data type (e.g., converting date columns to datetime type, numerical columns to 
 float or int).
 This step is essential for accurate calculations and analyses later on.
 
 3 Managing Outliers:

Analyzed the data for outliers using methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores.
Outliers were addressed either by removing them or transforming them if they were deemed to significantly skew the results.

Removing Duplicates:

Checked for duplicate entries within the dataset and removed them to maintain the integrity of the analysis.
The project focused on predicting stock prices using historical data. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, correct data types, and manage outliers, ensuring data quality. Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled for optimal modeling.

A Ridge regression model was selected for its ability to manage multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV identified the best model with an optimal alpha value of 1.

The model demonstrated strong performance during evaluation on both training and test datasets. It achieved a high R-squared score of 0.99 for both sets, indicating a robust fit. Mean squared error (MSE) metrics were also low, with values of 50.04 for training and 82.43 for testing, highlighting the model's predictive accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into stock price trends and relationships between variables. Visualizations such as line plots and scatter plots facilitated understanding of data patterns and influential factors affecting stock prices.

In summary, the project successfully applied machine learning techniques, specifically Ridge regression, to predict stock prices. Rigorous data preprocessing, effective model selection through hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation metrics underscored the project's methodology and findings. Future work could explore additional models or advanced feature engineering techniques to further enhance predictive capabilities.
