## Project Overview
The project focuses on predicting the closing stock prices of Yes Bank using historical data. It employs machine learning techniques to derive insights and make accurate predictions.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline. It involves the following sub-steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified missing values within the dataset.
   - Used appropriate methods to fill or remove these values, depending on their impact on the dataset. For instance, rows with excessive missing data might be dropped, while smaller gaps can be filled using techniques such as forward fill or interpolation.

2. **Correcting Data Types:**
   - Ensured that each column in the dataset had the correct data type (e.g., converting date columns to `datetime` type, numerical columns to `float` or `int`).
   - This step is essential for accurate calculations and analyses later on.

3. **Managing Outliers:**
   - Analyzed the data for outliers using methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores.
   - Outliers were addressed either by removing them or transforming them if they were deemed to significantly skew the results.

4. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Checked for duplicate entries within the dataset and removed them to maintain the integrity of the analysis.
### Categorical Encoding
- Categorical variables were identified and encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. This step ensures that categorical data can be effectively utilized in the machine learning model.

### Feature Scaling
- Numerical features were scaled using techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standardization. This process is crucial for algorithms like Ridge regression that are sensitive to the scale of input features.

## Model Selection
- **Algorithm Used:** A Ridge regression model was selected due to its ability to manage multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized GridSearchCV to identify the best model, resulting in an optimal alpha value of 1.

## Model Evaluation
The model demonstrated strong performance during evaluation on both training and test datasets. It achieved a high R-squared score of 0.98 before and 0.97 after hyperparameter tuning.Mean squared error (MSE) metrics were also low, with values of 39.03 before and 55.98 after tuning, highlighting the model's predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
The project focused on predicting stock prices using historical data. The dataset underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, correct data types, and manage outliers, ensuring data quality. Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled for optimal modeling.
A Ridge regression model was selected for its ability to manage multicollinearity and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV identified the best model with an optimal alpha value of 0.1.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into stock price trends and relationships between variables. Visualizations such as line plots and scatter plots facilitated understanding of data patterns and influential factors affecting stock prices.

In summary, the project successfully applied machine learning techniques, specifically Ridge regression, to predict stock prices. Rigorous data preprocessing, effective model selection through hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation metrics underscored the project's methodology and findings. Future work could explore additional models or advanced feature engineering techniques to further enhance predictive capabilities.

## Future Work
Future work could explore additional models or advanced feature engineering techniques to further enhance predictive capabilities. Considerations for using more complex algorithms, like LSTM or other deep learning approaches, could also be beneficial in capturing the temporal aspects of stock price movements.
